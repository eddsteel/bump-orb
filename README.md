# Bump orbs action

This action checks for updates to the orbs used in the given Circle CI configuration file. It may use a token to also check for updates to private orbs if provided. This is powered by the `circleci orbs list <namespace>` command, whose output is parsed and compared with the current defined versions. If a version has a non-production version specified (with the `<orb name>@dev:<commit>` syntax) it will be skipped.

## Inputs

### `config`

The filename to check, relative to the root of the workspace. By default this is `.circleci/config.yml` but it may be useful to configure if you have multiple workflows defined.

### `token`

The token used for authentication when running `circleci orbs list --private`. If provided, private orbs are checked for all namespaces, even though the token is probably only going to provide access to one of them.

### `ignore`

A newline separated list of orbs to ignore updates for.

e.g.
```yml
      uses: eddsteel/bump-orb@v1
      with:
        ignore: |
          eddsteel/ignore-this-orb
          eddsteel/ignore-this-one-too
```

## Outputs

### `summary`

A list of changed orbs, in markdown format. This is suitable for embedding in an automatic PR.
